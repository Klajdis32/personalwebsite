The photoelectric effect is a physical phenomenon where exposing the surface of a material (usually metal) to light causes the emission of electrons from its surface. Essentially, when a photon (quantum) strikes a material, it can transfer enough energy to the material's electrons to release them from the surface. By studying this phenomenon through an appropriate experimental setup and performing the mathematical analysis of the phenomenon while obtaining the proper experimental data, we can finally determine this constant with high precision. It should be emphasized that Planck's constant appears in many formulas in quantum physics, making its determination highly significant.",

Understanding this phenomenon introduces us to quantum mechanics and solid-state theory and has applications in many fields, from electronics to energy biochemistry.

Since it is not possible to directly measure its mass due to its magnitude (~10^-31), and as the electron's charge is known from previous experiments, we proceed by calculating the e/m ratio, which can be measured using a specialized experimental setup. Finally, using this ratio and the known charge, we can accurately determine the electron's mass. The study of the electron is a fundamental pillar in the field of physics and science in general. The electron is a significant particle, distinct from others like protons and neutrons, as it is not composed of sub-particles. Studying the electron is essential for understanding the properties of elementary particles and their behavior under various conditions.

The equipment used to implement this project includes a dual-beam oscilloscope and a frequency generator. In simple terms, through the frequency generator, which we connect to the oscilloscope using a cable, we send various signals of specific or unknown frequency towards the oscilloscope. We study each of these signals via the screen contained in the oscilloscope, with the aim of obtaining experimental data. This experimental data, through mathematical analysis, will lead us to the unknown values of amplitude, frequency, and phase of the sinusoidal signals that we aim to measure in each experiment. This methodical approach provides a hands-on experience of the fundamental principles of signal processing and waveform analysis, offering significant insights into the nature of sinusoidal signals.",

The ALU served as a crucial component responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. We started by designing the ALU's architecture, considering the necessary subunits such as adders, multipliers, dividers, and logic gates. Through careful interconnection of these subunits, we created a functional ALU. We conducted extensive simulations to test its accuracy and reliability, verifying that it produced correct results for various test cases. Throughout the project, we encountered challenges and developed problem-solving skills while gaining a deeper understanding of digital logic and circuit design. To further demonstrate our work, we have made the ALU design file available for review and testing. You can download and run it on Logisim to see our ALU in action.",
