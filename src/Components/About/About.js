            <p>
                I have a deep interest in physics, a field I am currently studying, which allows me to explore and understand the fundamental principles that govern the natural world. At the same time, I am equally passionate about programming, an area that fascinates me for its ability to solve problems and create innovative solutions.
            </p>
           
            <p>
                This combination of physics and programming drives my curiosity and inspires me to continue learning and growing in both domains.
